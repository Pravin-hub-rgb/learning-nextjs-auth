#  Authentication in Next.js 15 - Unified Project Plan

- We are going to define our **base project** once, then use the *same project idea* to implement all auth methods one by one. That way, we'll truly understand the differences and internal workings of authentication.
- There are **5 methods** to implement Authentication (1 being simplest and 5 being the most advanced):
  1. [Client-only Authentication (Beginner - Simplest)](./Documentation/level%201%20client%20side%20only.md), [Live Web App](https://nextjs-level1-auth.vercel.app/)
  2. [Supabase Auth](./Documentation/level%202%20Supabase%20Auth.md), [Live Web App](https://nextjs-level2-auth.vercel.app/)
  3. NextAuth.js
  4. Autho / Clerk / firebase Auth / Magic Links
  5. Custom Authentication System (Advanced)

- We are going to create a simple Next.js 15 project called:  
  
  > ## ` Auth Playground`
  
  This will be used to implement and understand various authentication methods ‚Äî from basic to advanced ‚Äî using the **App Router**, **Server Components**, and tools like **Supabase**, **NextAuth.js**, etc.

---

##  Project Goal

Build a minimal web app that has:

- ‚úÖ A Login Page (and Signup Page if needed)  
- üîí A Protected Route: `/secret`  
- üè† A Home Page: `/` ‚Äì open to everyone  
- üë§ Authenticated users can:  
  - View the Secret Page  
  - See their name/email in the navbar  
  - Logout  
- üö´ Unauthenticated users trying to access `/secret` are redirected to `/login`

---

##  Also Learning: Authentication State

In every method, we‚Äôll also learn how to **track and manage authentication state**, i.e., how the app knows whether a user is currently logged in or not.

We'll implement:

- Showing "Login" or "Logout" in the Navbar based on auth state  
- Displaying logged-in user‚Äôs name/email/photo (if available)  
- Conditionally rendering pages and routes based on login state  
- Handling logout and UI updates accordingly  

This is called managing the **Auth State** and is a critical part of real-world authentication flows.

##  Common UI Pages

We'll reuse the same page structure in every auth method:

| Route     | Description                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `/`       | Public home page                    |
| `/login`  | Login form                          |
| `/signup` | Signup form (if method supports it) |
| `/secret` | Protected page (requires login)     |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

We‚Äôll use:

- **Next.js 15 App Router**  
- **Tailwind CSS** (for basic styling)  
- **ShadCN** or simple HTML forms  
- A global **Layout with Navbar** that shows Login/Logout buttons based on Auth State  
- **Client components** (`'use client'`) where needed for interactivity

##  Benchmark Checklist for Each Method

Use this exact checklist for **all five** authentication methods. You can keep each level in its own project folder.

### 1. Authentication Functionality

| Feature                        | Required? | Notes                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------ |
|  Login                        | Yes       | Dummy/local/real API           |
|  Logout                       | Yes       | Clear session/token/etc.       |
|  Signup *(if supported)*      | Optional  | Only if the method supports it |
|  Session Persistence          | Yes       | localStorage, cookies, JWT     |
|  Route Protection (`/secret`) | Yes       | Redirect if not logged in      |

### 2. Authentication State (Frontend Logic)

| Feature                           | Required? | Notes                                 |
| --------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
|  Detect if user is logged in     | Yes       | On mount via context/provider         |
|  Show login/logout conditionally | Yes       | In Navbar, based on context state     |
|  Display user info (name/email)  | Yes       | From context                          |
|  Redirect after login/logout     | Yes       | e.g., login ‚Üí `/secret`, logout ‚Üí `/` |
|  Update UI on login/logout       | Yes       | State managed via context             |

### 3. Pages (Route Checklist)
